# Project Context: Hotel Management System

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Next.js Web Frontend.
- `backend/`: Express.js Backend.
- `mobile/`(if not present, it means I moved it outside, chat will focus on web app): React Native migrated from `src/`.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript.
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript, MySQL (located in `backend/`).

## Rules & Preferences
- If the chat open with web app, it will focus on the Web Frontend.
- If the chat open with mobile app, it will focus on the Mobile App.
- There are 2 separate repositories for 'backend/'(backend) and all others except 'mobile/'(frontend).
- Do not create new md files in project, but artifacts still can be created if planning mode is active.
- Do not run 'npm run dev'.
- Check and fix errors of edited files after finish a job.
- consolidated_migrations.sql is the file that contains all migrations for the database.
